# Foundry Storage Project

This folder contains a simple Storage smart contract project built with Foundry. It demonstrates how to:

- Write a basic Solidity contract (`Storage.sol`) that stores and retrieves a value.
- Test the contract using Forge's fast testing framework.
- Deploy the contract using Foundry scripts.

The project is ideal for learning and comparing Foundry's workflow with other Ethereum development tools.

## Foundry Overview

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

- **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
- **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
- **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
- **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
