# Hardhat Storage Project

This folder contains a simple Storage smart contract project built with Hardhat. It demonstrates how to:

- Write a basic Solidity contract (`Storage.sol`) that stores and retrieves a value.
- Test the contract using Hardhat's testing framework.
- Deploy the contract using Hardhat Ignition modules.

The project is ideal for learning and comparing Hardhat's workflow with other Ethereum development tools.

## Usage

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Storage.js
```
